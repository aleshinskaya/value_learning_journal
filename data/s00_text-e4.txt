I started the day with a really interesting interview for a cool possibility so that was really really nice and I'm interested I don't know if that will you know pan out but it was a thing that was really interesting and just validating.

And then also someone tweeted about my work. I take that really to heart which may or may not be good but really it was really validating. Someone said good things about my work on Twitter. It's such a big deal.

So wow that was good but overall I was really tired.  I think I probably just need rest and I'm having trouble admitting that. And here I am still trying to work on everything up until midnight.

Oh those were interesting observations. Yeah those are those are some things that were meaningful today and yeah I feel like there are opportunities around me. That's a really good thing and those are all really great. I'm planning a ski trip with some friends and excited about that. I think it'll be a really nice group so sort of trying to invest in a relationship there and that might be good. But yeah I'm excited to get out in the snow. I mean it's like mid-february I need to be out there you know? This is for March actually. I am really bummed that work has taken over my winter in a way that has made it really hard to get out and that's just... that's just really sad. So it's good to be able to have this thing going as a plan and I'm really looking forward to that.

In general my March plans seem really fun. There's gonna be a weekend where I go out and build on a piece of land that I share with a friend and that's really really gonna be nice. So I have plans I'm forming that I'm looking forward to and feeling excitement about my work and I just need to manage the fatigue from all the things I'm doing.
