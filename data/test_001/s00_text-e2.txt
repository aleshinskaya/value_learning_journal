A Day of Challenges Softened by Friendship

Today was exceptionally hard. 
So what did I find valuable about my day? 
It's a hard one, but I did get a lot of support from my friends. That was really, really powerful. They were able to help me see things in a different way and tackle my challenge. So I know that I have support, and that's really incredibly powerful. 
So that was meaningful. That was a meaningful part of my day. 
The rest was not great because I just spent it all trying to deal with this really, really difficult issue that just sucked all of my time, and I was not good at all. I did not appreciate having to just fight this thing. That's pretty general. 
I also had a helpful call with a friend in the morning who was able, again, to give me some really good advice about things. 
So I'm gonna just appreciate the, you know, wisdom and confidence of my friends and their ability to just, like, on a dime, really, talk to me and help out. 
And I'm really hoping to make some progress on my work today, even though it's late evening. I think I can hopefully just dive in with the rest of the day. I'm looking forward to that. 
I'm looking forward to a late-night walk up the hill. I always enjoy that. And maybe I'll see a coyote or two, which is always fun. 
Hopefully take a break at some point later tonight, but it's been difficult today. I will say that.
