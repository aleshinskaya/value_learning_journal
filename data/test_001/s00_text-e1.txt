Just an entry for the meaningful things prompts I'd like to actually reflect on Thursday last week which was really meaningful in a lot of ways.

I went out to Stanford to give a talk in my friend's lab and it was such a gratifying day. It was so meaningful that my friend gave me the chance to present and I had so many really interested and engaged audience members from his lab and others lab and it was really validating.

It was so wonderful to have such support and a little bit of visibility so I was so appreciative of that. The day just flew by and I was so just like happy to be there and I'm really glad that my colleague was able to join me. Last minute I thought he might not have been able to go and I it was really great that he was able to join and we were able to just have a beautiful chat about it afterwards and the weather was perfect and then I had coffee with someone that I'd met at a conference who I thought was really interesting and we had a beautiful chat.

We just had a great conversation and that was really meaningful just to be able to spend some time connecting with another person. We have some similar struggles and questions and ideas and it was really good to connect and it was just it was just a good day. I felt really rich in a lot of ways and I had a lot of energy at the end of it which was really awesome.

So that was what was meaningful for me on Thursday last week.
