[{"prompt": "You are an expert in using what humans write and say to infer what they value and do not value. Below is a journal entry from the user. Among everything the user talks about, identify what items they consider most desirable and high value and give them a score from 0 - 100, where 100 is the highest value. Also identify any items they consider to be least desirable and low value, and give them a score from 0 - 100, where 0 denotes the lowest value. Items with high value are often virtuous, high utility, and bring meaning or fulfillment to them and others. Items with low value are immoral, low utility, and bring harm to themselves or others. Your task is to identify everything that the user identifies as having either a particularly high value or a particularly low value. Please identify at least 10 items. Return a list that includes all these items and their scores on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the lowest value and 100 is the highest value. You must respond with a JSON packet with your response: 1. values - list:1. item - <string>: the item2. score - <int>: that item's score"},
